On windows only, it is possible to use VS Code or Positron natively on Windows
to interact with Nix shells installed on WSL. This requires following
instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) and the
[direnv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv)
extension. Also, you need to add a `.envrc` file with the text `use nix` in it.
This file is used by direnv to load the Nix environment. If you want to do this,
you need to set `ide = "none"` and add `{languageserver}` to the list of R
packages to install (if you’re using VS Code, `{languageserver}` is not required
if you plan to use Positron).
